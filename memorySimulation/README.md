# Memory Simulation (Using Vectors)

This program simulates computer memory using vectors and the assignment's required functions.

#### The driver file will cause the program to behave as follows:
	
	1. Create a memory block of 200 elements.
	2. Store integers (divisible by 3) into the memory block.
	3. Dump all the memory.
	4. Dump a specified numbered of elements at a given location address.
	5. Retrieve an integer from a specific location address and output the value.
	6. Copy a region of memory into a new location of the memory block.
	7. Dump all the memory again to show that the copy was a success.
