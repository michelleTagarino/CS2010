# Dictionary 1
This simple, unordered dictionary takes in a standard *.txt* file, stores each word in a two-dimensional char array, and outputs the list of words in the order that they occur in the file. It also outputs the number of times that the word appeared in the file.

## Let's Get You Started

To compile:

	$ make dictionary1

To run:

	$ ./dictionary1 < FILE (where FILE is the name of your .txt file or any text file of your choice)
